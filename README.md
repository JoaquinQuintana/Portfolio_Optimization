# Portfolio_Optimization
Portfolio Optimization Using a Linear Algebra Approach

In this notebook we look at portfolio optimization using a linear algebra approach. I start by going through an example in chapter 17 of the VMLS textbook [1] and then use these techniques on my own data set to further explain portfolio optimization. The data for the example problem was acquired from Jessica Wyleung whom is the the author of the pyhton companion note book and was kind enough to place the data set on her github for others to use: https://github.com/jessica-wyleung/VMLS-py. Credit for Algortihms port_opt, back_subst, QR Factorization, solve_via_backsub and gram_schmidt goes to the authors of the Python Companion Notebook [2].
